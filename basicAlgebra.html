		<h1> Terms</h1>
		<h2>The Language of Algebra | Terms </h2>
		<p>To understand algebraic equations and expressions we first need to define some terms.</p>
		<p>For example, let's use the expression 5x + 8y - 6</p>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<ul class="Definition">
			<li id="algebraicExpression"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Algebraic Expression</em></span> - One or more algebraic terms in a phrase. Each term in divided by a plus or a minus, so the expression 5x+8y-6 has three terms: 5x, 8y, -6. Don't forget that you need to take the sign with the term, so you need to keep in mind if the number is positive or negative.</li>
			<li id="variables"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Variables</em></span> - The unknowns, or letters, of an expression. In the above example x and y are the variables. 
			<li id="coefficients"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Coefficients</em></span> - Coefficients are the numbers next to the variables. For example, in the example above 5 and 8 are the coefficients.  </li>
			<li id="constants"><span class="definitionTitle"><em> Constants </em></span> - The stand-alone numbers that are not being multiplied by a variable. In the example above -6 is the constant. Don't forget to take the sign with each term, so the constant is going to be negative.</li>

			<li id="polynomials"><span class="definitionTitle"><em> Polynomials </em></span>- Polynomials are a fancie way to say algebraic expressions, but expressions with different number of terms have different names. For example, an expression with only one term (2x) is called a monomial. An expression with two terms (2x+7y) is called a binomial. An expression with three terms (2x+7y-9) is called a trinomaial. Any expression with more than three terms is called a polynomial.</li>

			<li id="equations"><span class="definitionTitle"><em> Equations </em></span>- Equations are expressions that equal something. You can identify an equation if you can find the = sign. For example, 2x-4 is a binomial, but 2x-4=10 is an equation.</li> 
			<li id="formulas"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Formulas</em></span> - A formula is an equation where you are given some numbers and you "plug them into" the equation to get a desired answer.For example, if you have a box that is 3 x 4 x 5 and you want to find the volume of the box you can use the Volume Formula for a Rectangle. The formula is Volume = Length x Width x Height, so if we plug in the numbers we have (3,4,5) we get the equation Volume = 3 x 4 x 5. Once multiplied we find that the volume equals 60.  </li>

			<li id="inequalities"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Inequalities</em></span> - Inequalities are similar to equations, but not the exact same. Equations tell you the exact value of a variable, but inequalities tell you the range in which a solution for a varaible could fall. Instead of the equal sign (=) inequalities use the greater than sign (>), less than sign (<), greater than or equal to sign (&ge;), or the less than or equal to sign (&le;).For example, you could have something like 5x-1 &le; 9.</li>

			<li id="likeTerms"><span class="definitionTitle"><em>Like Terms</em></span> - When two terms have the same variables rised to the same power it is said they are like terms. If two terms are like terms you can add them together by adding the coefficients and keeping the variables the same. For example, you can't combine apples and oranges to make apple pie, but if you have apples and apples you can maka apple pie.</li>
